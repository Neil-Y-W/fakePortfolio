           <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
           <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. Javascript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. 
               It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. 
               Javascript lives inside a host environment(a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li class="tab">
                <span class="tealunderline";>Variable Declaration</span> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds
                a value. All Javascript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class = "purple";>var x;</span>
            </li>
            <li class="tab"> <span class="tealunderline";>Variable assignment</span> Assignment operators assign values to Javascipt variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variables a value to hold. The 
                = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class = "purple";>var x = 10</span>

            </li>
            <li class="tab"> <span class="tealunderline";>Data Types</span> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are javascript primitives:
                Boolean - <span class = "purple";>true</span> or <span class = "purple";>false</span>: null - <span class = "purple";>null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class = "purple";>42</span> or <span class = "purple";>3.14159</span>; String - <span class = "purple";>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array- <span class = "purple";>[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span class = "purple";>{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span>

            </li>
            <li class="tab"> <span class="tealunderline";>Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions-hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use
                conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span class = "purple";>if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class = "purple";>else if</span> 
                to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false;<span class = "purple";>else</span> we execute this block of code;
                
            </li>
            <li class="tab"> <span class="tealunderline";>Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: They will repeat an actions
                some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!
            </li>
            <li class="tab">
                <span class="tealunderline";>Function</span> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of 
                instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first wescrew the legs to the
                table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over 
                and over again.

            </li>
            </ul>
